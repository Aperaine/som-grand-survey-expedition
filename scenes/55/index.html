        <h1 class="title">The Forest of Many Tree-Like Things...</br>That Are Not Actually Trees</h1>
        <p>
            The Forest of Many Tree-Like Things was born from experiments gone wrong—when devs tried to copy-paste things from an LLM.<br>
            Each attempt produced something that looked almost right, but never quite: unknown species, fake branches, bizarre layouts.<br>
            Over time, these half-formed trees spread across the land, patching themselves together in a hell of a forest.<br>
            Now it grows endlessly, a monument to trial, error, and autocomplete.<br><br>
            Would you like to help catalog these strange things before the history gets too messy?
